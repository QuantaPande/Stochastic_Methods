# Stochastic_Methods
A code repository for the projects I conducted for the course EE 511: Simulation Methods for Stochastic Processes

Project 0: Finding the logest sequence of heads in a binomial trial and finding the probability of the different lengths

Project 1: Checking the randomness of a random number generator using covariance

Project 2: Monte Carlo methods. Using Monte Carlo to predict the probability of different poker hands

Project 4: Probability experiments on a number of different sequence suing Monte Carlo

Project 5: Using Monte Carlo Methods to develop a simulation for a ALOHA Wifi system

Project 6: Different methods of generating random variables: Inversion method and rejection method

Project 7: Simulation of a bank queuing system using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Project 8: Bootstrapping
