%AIM   : To simulate the queuing system at a bank, specifically the case with
%a single queue and three tellers capable of handling any type of
%transaction

%Email : tpande@usc.edu

%A brief description of the variables used in the program:
% 1. lambda: The arrival rate for customers at the bank
% 2. teller: The status vector for the tellers
% 3. teller_busy: The vector which stores the time till which the teller
%                 will remain busy
% 4. top: The variable which points to the last element in the queue
% 5. count: The iterative variable for the delay of customer type 1
% 6. count2: The iterative variable for the delay of customer type 2
% 7. idle: The time for which the teller is idle
% 8. customer_type: The queue of customers
% 9. delay: The delay experienced by each customer
%10. p: The number of customers which come every minute
%11. r: The random variable which decides the type of the customer
%12. t: The servicing time for a customer
%13. current_j: The time at which a teller starts servicing a customer
%14. delay_end: The time difference for each customer between arrival and
%               service
%15. delay_avg: The average delay experienced by all customers for a
%               specific arrival rate
%16. queue_length: The length of the queue after each minute
%17. queue_length_avg: The average length of the queue for a specific
%                      arrival rate
%18. tot_idle: The total time for which tellers remain idle for a specific
%              arrival rate
%19. delay_end1: The variable to store the value of delays of customer type
%                1 for easier manipulation of the data
%20. delay_end2: The variable to store the value of delays of customer type
%                2 for easier manipulation of the data
